    "# Report: Library coverage of SJR titles\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Description\n",
    "This notebook allows you to compare list(s) of journal titles from __[Scimago Journal Ranking reports (SJR)](https://www.scimagojr.com/)__ against your library's holdings of journals in Primo. It will generate a spreadsheet of the full-text availability for all titles in the report, automatically!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dependencies & requirements\n",
    "This notebook queries the Alma link resolver, so this will only work for libraries that use Primo.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this notebook, you will need:\n",
    "* Python 3\n",
    "* Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "* The open source packages that are loaded below\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes & disclaimer\n",
    "This code may not be perfect, so it is worth double checking the results. Errors will also be introduced based on the metadata quality:\n",
    "* The ISSNs provided by the SJR report may not match up with the ISSNs in your MARC records\n",
    "* The coverage availability statements are pulled from the link resolver, which are only as good as your electronic records in Alma\n",
    "\n",
    "I am always welcome to collaboration -- if this work can be improved, please reach out!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Author\n",
    "Created by Roger Reka and last updated 9 February 2023.\n",
